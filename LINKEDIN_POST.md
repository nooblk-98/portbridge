# 🚀 Introducing Port Bridge: The Easiest Way to Bridge Your Ports & Manage WireGuard!

I'm excited to share **Port Bridge**, a new open-source tool I've been working on to solve a common headache for developers and homelab enthusiasts: **Exposing local services to the world securely.**

We've all been there: You're working on a project on your local machine, but you need to show it to a client, test a webhook, or host a game server from home. You're stuck behind a carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT) or restrictive router APIs.

**Port Bridge** keeps it simple. It combines the speed of **WireGuard** with a clean, modern UI to manage port forwarding dynamically.

## 🛠 What does it do?
✅ **WireGuard Manager:** Create and manage VPN clients effortlessly. Scan a QR code and you're connected.
✅ **Dynamic Port Forwarding:** Forward a TCP/UDP port from your public server (VPS) directly to any connected client.
✅ **Real-time Dashboard:** Monitor network usage, active ports, and connected peers.
✅ **Self-Hosted & Secure:** You own the infrastructure. No third-party tunnels snoping on your traffic.

## 💡 Top Use Cases
1.  **Expose Localhost:** Forward port `80` on your VPS to port `3000` on your laptop. Show off your work instantly.
2.  **Bypass CGNAT:** Host a web server or Plex from your home, even if your ISP doesn't give you a public IP.
3.  **Gaming:** Host a Minecraft or Valheim server on your powerful home rigor and let friends connect via your VPS IP.
4.  **Secure Private Network:** Access your home network securely from anywhere in the world.

## 🤝 Contributors Welcome!
This is an open-source project, and I'd love to see it grow! Whether you're into Python/Flask, Frontend (Tailwind/Alpine.js), or Networking (iptables/WireGuard), your contributions are welcome. We have a lot of cool features planned!
